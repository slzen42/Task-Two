            <h3>Ancient Greek Architecture</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greek architecture is distinguished by its highly formalized characteristics, both of structure and decoration. This is most evident in the temples and public buildings constructed in ancient Greece, such as the Parthenon in Athens and the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.</p>
            <p>The ancient Greeks developed three architectural styles known as orders: the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders. Each order has its unique characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doric Order:</strong> The Doric order is the simplest and sturdiest. It features plain, saucer-shaped capitals and columns without bases.</li>
                <li><strong>Ionic Order:</strong> The Ionic order is more slender and elegant. It is easily recognized by its scroll-like volutes on the capitals and bases for the columns.</li>
                <li><strong>Corinthian Order:</strong> The Corinthian order is the most ornate, characterized by elaborate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Greek temples were designed to house the cult statue of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated. They were built to be admired from the outside and often positioned on elevated ground for maximum visual impact.</p>
            <p>Besides temples, the Greeks also built theaters, stadiums, and other public buildings. These structures were often designed with careful attention to proportions and symmetry, reflecting the Greeks' appreciation for harmony and balance.</p>

            <p>Greek architecture influenced the development of Roman architecture and, through it, architecture to the present day. Many of the styles and techniques pioneered by the Greeks can be seen in later periods, including the Renaissance and Neoclassical movements.</p>
            <p>Greek houses typically consisted of two or three rooms, built around a courtyard, with the kitchen, bathing rooms, and toilet on the ground floor. Wealthier Greeks had larger homes with additional rooms and finer furnishings. The materials used were often stone, wood, and clay bricks.</p>
            <p>Public spaces in Greek cities included the agora (marketplace) and the gymnasium, where citizens could engage in commerce and physical activities. These areas were essential to the social and economic life of the city-state.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <h3 id="about-greece">Ancient Greece</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greece, a civilization that flourished from around the 8th century BCE to the end of antiquity (c. 600 AD), is renowned for its contributions to modern philosophy, politics, art, and science. This period in history gave birth to notable figures such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, whose ideas have shaped Western thought.</p>
            <p>Greek city-states, such as Athens and Sparta, were known for their distinct forms of government and societal structure. Athens is celebrated for establishing democracy, where citizens had the power to vote on legislative matters. Sparta, on the other hand, was a warrior society focused on military training and excellence.</p>
            <p>The cultural achievements of Ancient Greece include monumental works of architecture like the Parthenon, epic literary works such as Homer's "Iliad" and "Odyssey," and the origins of the Olympic Games. These accomplishments have left an enduring legacy on subsequent generations and civilizations.</p>

            <h3 id="about-architecture">Greek Architecture</h3>
            <p>Greek architecture is known for its tall columns, symmetrical shapes, and intricate details. Temples were the most important and widespread form of Greek architecture, used to worship gods and goddesses.</p>
            <p>Temples were not the only significant structures in Ancient Greece. Theaters were another prominent type of building, reflecting the importance of drama and performance in Greek culture. The open-air theaters, such as the Theatre of Epidaurus, were ingeniously designed to provide excellent acoustics and visibility for large audiences.</p>
            <p>The Greeks also constructed impressive public buildings, including the stoas (covered walkways) and the bouleuterion (council houses). These buildings were central to public life and served as places for political and social gatherings.</p>
            <p>In addition to their architectural innovations, the Greeks developed significant urban planning concepts. The grid plan, attributed to Hippodamus of Miletus, was a revolutionary idea that influenced city planning in the Hellenistic period and beyond. This methodical approach to urban design can be seen in the layout of cities like Piraeus and Priene.</p>

            <h3 id="about-history">Greek History</h3>
            <p>Ancient Greek history is rich and varied, covering a wide range of topics and periods. The early Greek civilization began with the Mycenaean and Minoan cultures, which laid the foundations for the later development of Greek society. The Mycenaeans, known for their palatial centers, were influential in the development of Greek culture and mythology.</p>
            <p>The Archaic period (c. 800–480 BCE) saw the rise of the city-states, or polis, each with its own government and way of life. This period also witnessed the establishment of the Olympic Games and significant advancements in art and literature.</p>
            <p>The Classical period (c. 480–323 BCE) was marked by great achievements in philosophy, drama, and the arts. This era saw the construction of the Parthenon, the writings of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, and the rise of Athenian democracy. It was also a time of conflict, including the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War.</p>
            <p>The Hellenistic period (323–31 BCE) followed the conquests of Alexander the Great, who spread Greek culture across a vast empire that stretched from Greece to Egypt and into Asia. This period was characterized by the blending of Greek and other cultures, leading to advancements in science, philosophy, and the arts.</p>
            <p>Greek history continued to evolve under Roman rule, which began in the 2nd century BCE. The Romans admired and adopted many aspects of Greek culture, ensuring its survival and influence throughout the Roman Empire and beyond.</p>
